Good codes of conduct spell out acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Is your project trying to target young children, getting them to write for an open-source project from a young age? Then you'll probably want to specify that contributors should keep cursing (normally acceptable on the internet) to a minimum. Writing an app to provide support resources for victims of sexual assault and harassment? The community should be sensitive to the needs of those with PTSD, and you'll want to spell that out.
They also should lay out what happens when something goes wrong. You'll usually want to start by simply allowing the offending party to apologize, sincerely, to those who they wronged. If it's particularly egregious, a suspension or even permanent expulsion from the project can be warranted.
Implicit in this is a statement of the values of the project community. How a code of conduct is written and even its existence can indicate what a community values: welcoming marginalized people, writing good code, being nice to newcomers.

This project is for the general public. Just try to keep language respectful and considerate. This project is not targeted to a specific group, 
so it should be easy to avoid alienating other contributors. 

If a contributor has committed a wrongdoing, they must first apologize to the offended party. If the act was too seriously wrong, the contributor 
can be banned from the project. 

This project community values respect towards all people and contributors, and the writing of excellent code.
