# Week-6-VC-lab
for part 1 of our group assignment

Description:
Inside of the actual_code notebook, we created a variable called "name" that asks the user to input their name. Then, at the end of the
program, we wrote a line that prints "Hello," then the name of the user.

We also added a variable called "dogage" that multiplies the input of the user's age by 7 and then tells them how old they would be if they were a dog.
