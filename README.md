# Week-6-VC-lab
for part 1 of our group assignment

Description:
Inside of the actual_code notebook, we created a variable called "name" that asks the user to input their name. Then, at the end of the
program, we wrote a line that prints "Hello," then the name of the user.

We also added a variable called "dogage" that multiplies the input of the user's age by 7 and then tells them how old they would be if they were a dog.

Group members: Brooklyn Castleberry, Karlynn Riccitelli

What the software does:
To use the software, enter your name when prompted to. Then enter your age when prompted to. The software will then greet you, and tell you how old you would be if you were a dog. 

How to use it:
The software can be installed by cloning the code from the GitHub repository. It should then run in a file called actual_code.ipynb.

How to contribute:
Feel free to add to the code!
